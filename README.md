# Frontend Mentor - Blood Donation Landing Page Challenge

![Design file for the Blood Donation Landing Page Challenge](./design/blood-donation-landing-design.jpg)

Welcome! Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge. 

Your task is to build out the project to the design inside the `/design` folder.

This project poses some nice challenges using CSS gradients. You'll need to place two gradients as a background on the `body` and figure out how to reduce the intensity of the colours.

**The challenge does not require any JavaScript and should not include any front-end frameworks/libraries**.

If you decide to push the project live, tweet **@frontendmentor** once you're finished with your URL in the tweet. I'd love to take a look at what you've built!

Feedback is always welcome, so if you have any regarding this challenge please email me at matt[at]frontendmentor[dot]io.

Have fun building!
